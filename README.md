## Features
- **Decentralized Document Storage**: Store document metadata on the blockchain for enhanced security.
- **Secure Verification**: Verify document authenticity with a blockchain-based ledger to prevent tampering or unauthorized modifications.
- **Transparent Access**: Publicly accessible validation records, ensuring transparency and reliability in the verification process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A React-based UI for an intuitive experience.


## Usage

1. **Admin Panel**:
   - Accessible only by the ownerâ€™s address (set in the environment configuration).
   - Allows adding and deleting document issuers (authorities).

2. **Add Document Issuer**:
   - Admin can add new authorities responsible for issuing documents.
   - Authority information is stored on the blockchain for transparency.

3. **View Logs**:
   - Track all registered authorities and changes, including the timestamp for each action.

4. **Verify Document**:
   - Users can verify the validity of a document by searching for its issuer and corresponding data on the blockchain.

5. **View Issued Document**:
   - View or find specific issued documents by entering the credentials used at issuance (such as user ID and email).
   - This feature helps users or authorities quickly locate and verify document details on the blockchain for validation purposes.

**Note: Viewing documents does not require a Metamask account. However, a Metamask account is necessary for performing other operations, such as document issuance or verification.**

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Smart contracts (using Solidity)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia testnet for testing)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: 
  - Web3.js for interacting with the blockchain
  - Context API for state management
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

## Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (>= 14.0.0)
2. **npm** (or **yarn**)
3. **Metamask** browser extension (or any other Ethereum wallet)
4. Access to the **Sepolia Ethereum Testnet**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docchain.git
cd docchain
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the following variables:
```plaintext
REACT_APP_INFURA_API_KEY=<Your Infura Project ID>
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Your Deployed Smart Contract Address>
REACT_APP_OWNER_ADDRESS=<Owner's Wallet Address for Admin Privileges>
```

### 4. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 5. Connect to Metamask
Make sure your Metamask is connected to the **Sepolia testnet**. Import test ETH from a faucet if necessary for transaction testing.

## Contract Deployment

### Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract
1. **Compile** the contract using a tool like [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or Hardhat.
2. **Deploy** the contract on the Sepolia testnet.
3. Note down the contract address and update the `.env` file with the `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

### Update Contract ABI
Ensure that the compiled contract ABI is imported into your application to facilitate blockchain interactions.
