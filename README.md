# DocChain

DocChain is a decentralized application (DApp) for secure document validation and verification, utilizing blockchain technology to prevent fraud. Built using smart contracts, DocChain allows users to upload, view, and verify various documents like certificates and degrees with enhanced transparency and security.

## Features
- **Decentralized Document Storage**: Store document metadata on the blockchain for enhanced security.
- **Secure Verification**: Verify document authenticity with a blockchain-based ledger to prevent tampering or unauthorized modifications.
- **Transparent Access**: Publicly accessible validation records, ensuring transparency and reliability in the verification process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A React-based UI for an intuitive experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Smart contracts (using Solidity)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia testnet for testing)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: 
  - Web3.js for interacting with the blockchain
  - Context API for state management
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

## Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (>= 14.0.0)
2. **npm** (or **yarn**)
3. **Metamask** browser extension (or any other Ethereum wallet)
4. Access to the **Sepolia Ethereum Testnet**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docchain.git
cd docchain
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the following variables:
```plaintext
REACT_APP_INFURA_API_KEY=<Your Infura Project ID>
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Your Deployed Smart Contract Address>
REACT_APP_OWNER_ADDRESS=<Owner's Wallet Address for Admin Privileges>
```

### 4. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 5. Connect to Metamask
Make sure your Metamask is connected to the **Sepolia testnet**. Import test ETH from a faucet if necessary for transaction testing.

## Usage

1. **Admin Panel**:
   - Accessible only by the owner’s address (set in the environment configuration).
   - Allows adding and deleting document issuers (authorities).

2. **Add Document Issuer**:
   - Admin can add new authorities responsible for issuing documents.
   - Authority information is stored on the blockchain for transparency.

3. **View Logs**:
   - Track all registered authorities and changes, including the timestamp for each action.

4. **Verify Document**:
   - Users can verify the validity of a document by searching for its issuer and corresponding data on the blockchain.

5. **Find Issued Document**:
   - View or find specific issued documents by entering the credentials used at issuance (such as document ID, authority name, or other metadata).
   - This feature helps users or authorities quickly locate and verify document details on the blockchain for validation purposes.

## Contract Deployment

### Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract
1. **Compile** the contract using a tool like [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or Truffle.
2. **Deploy** the contract on the Sepolia testnet.
3. Note down the contract address and update the `.env` file with the `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

### Update Contract ABI
Ensure that the compiled contract ABI is imported into your application to facilitate blockchain interactions.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

### Steps to Contribute
1. Fork the project.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
